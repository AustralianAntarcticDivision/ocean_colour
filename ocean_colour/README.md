Two scripts to process Level-3 bin NASA ocean colour SeaWiFS and MODISA Remote Sensing Reflectance values into chlorophyll-a, using NASA's global oceancolor algorithm, as well as the Southern ocean specific "johnson" algorithm.

Collection size

-   SeaWiFS: 47Gb (source 1997-2012 SYYYYJJJ.L3b\_DAY\_RRS is 107Gb)
-   MODISA: 241Gb (source 2002-current AYYYYJJJ.L3b\_DAY\_RRS is *bigger*)
